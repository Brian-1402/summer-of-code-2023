# Week 1

### General

- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-design-a-tiny-url-or-url-shortener/

- You can learn detailed SQL in a matter of hours, you can also learn basic html/css/js in a day. I suggest that the earlier you do this, the easier things would be.

### Servers

- https://realpython.com/python-sockets/

- Go through [this link](https://docs.python.org/3/library/internet.html) and look at adjacent topics of http.server and later topics.

- Look into what cgi is and try to implement that
