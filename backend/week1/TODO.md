## Immediate

- Check out week 2 topics, while still trying to refine week1 content like adding error handling etc.

- Find out why they need the create endpoint to be a POST request and how to make a browser send such a request and how to respond to a POST request. It might require using CGIHTTPHandler, so in that case, see if redirects can be done.

## Later

### General

- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-design-a-tiny-url-or-url-shortener/

- You can learn detailed SQL in a matter of hours, you can also learn basic html/css/js in a day. I suggest that the earlier you do this, the easier things would be.

### Servers

- https://realpython.com/python-sockets/

- Go through [this link](https://docs.python.org/3/library/internet.html) and look at adjacent topics of http.server and later topics.

- Look into what cgi is and try to implement that
